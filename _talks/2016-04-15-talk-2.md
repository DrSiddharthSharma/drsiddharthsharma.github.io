A detailed overview on the graphene field effect transistor (G-FET) based biosensors
has been reviewed. The zero band gap and electro active nature of graphene allow it to be used in
various bio sensing applications. Owing to the unique mechanical, optical and electronic
properties of graphene, researchers have developed ultrafast transistors. G-FETâ€™s are now
exploring out of their shell beyond electronic applications toward biomedical areas such as
precise bio sensing. G-FET based PH and protein adsorption sensors have been developed.
Due to small noise and high trans conductance of GFETs fabricated on single layer graphene
produced by chemical vapor deposition, they are used for electrical detection of DNA
hybridization. A highly sensitive and specific GFET based biosensor has been developed to
detect E. coli bacteria electrically. Solution gated transistors has been fabricated from
graphene which can also be used as transducers for the recording of the electrical activity of
living cells . Although there are several challenges, initial results in these areas point toward
great potential for GFET in bio sensing.
