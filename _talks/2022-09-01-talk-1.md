Transition metal nitrides-based thin-film supercapacitors are attracting researchers around the
globe owing to their high-class electrochemical performances, good sustainability, and
considerable voltage window. The present work presents the single-step fabrication of
tungsten nitride (W 2 N) on a silicon (Si) wafer for highly efficient symmetric supercapacitor
(SC) applications. The reactive sputtering technique is used to deposite the metal nitrides in
aron and nirogen (Ar/N 2 ) environment. The SC is fabricated using W 2 N@Si as the working
electrode. All the electrochemical studies are performed in aqueous 1M Na 2 SO 4 at different
current densities and scan rates. The structural, morphological, and crystallographic
characterizations of the electrode are also performed. The W 2 N@Si electrode-based
symmetric supercapacitor demonstrated in this work show exceptional electrochemical
stability and capacitive performance, broader voltage window, good adhesion, and excellent
cycle life. Owing to these interesting properties, the proposed SC can be considered as a
promising candidate toward the fabrication of energy storage devices.
