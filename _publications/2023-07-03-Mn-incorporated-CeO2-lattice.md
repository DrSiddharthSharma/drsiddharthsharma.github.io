The greater charge transfer rate and variable oxidation states makes cerium oxides a potential candidate to be used for energy storage application. Also, doping heteroatom in the architecture of well-structured cerium oxide can significantly improve capacitive performance. Here, Mn-doped CeO2-based nanostructured thin film was synthesized via the Pulse laser deposition method for the accomplishment of the supercapacitive performance of the electrode. Due to the incorporation of Mn into the lattice of CeO2 thin film electrode, the specific capacitance of Mn-doped CeO2 thin film electrode has been increased from 292 Fg-1 to 395 Fg-1 at 2 mAcm-2 current density. Consequently, the Mn-doped CeO2 thin film electrode’s capacitance retention has been increased from 88.6% to 92.5% in an aqueous 0.5 M Li2SO4 electrolyte solution. Later, an Mn-CeO2//Mn-CeO2@SS device was fabricated using identical thin-film electrodes, which exhibit a specific capacitance of 85 Fg-1 at 2 mAcm-2 current density within the working voltage window of + 1.2 V. The SS (symmetric supercapacitor) device with high energy and power densities of 31 Wh kg-1 and 1673 Wkg-1 respectively, also exhibits excellent cyclic retention of 87.6% even after 10,000 cycles. The Mn-doped CeO2 Symmetric supercapacitor device’s electrochemical richness makes it an appropriate material for supercapacitor applications.
