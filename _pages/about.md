About Siddharth Sharma

Welcome to my website! I'm Siddharth Sharma.

I am an innovative researcher specializing in nanobiotechnology's energy storage and generation domain. With a strong background in electronics and nanotechnology, I am passionate about applying these concepts to biomedical engineering to create groundbreaking solutions that revolutionize healthcare and sustainable energy systems. Throughout my research journey, I have focused on inventing transformative technologies that address critical challenges in the field. I have gained valuable experience collaborating with interdisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, and medical professionals.
I aspire to contribute to a visionary organization committed to advancing biomedical engineering and transforming the landscape of healthcare and sustainable energy. I am currently associated with IIT Roorkee as a Senior Researcher

My research interests are energy generation and storage devices (nanogenerators and supercapacitors), biosensors, thin films, carbon nanotubes, graphene and polymer Nano-composites

Innovations
1. Biocompatible and Flexible supercapacitors for implantable and wearable electronic devices
   Outcomes: 8 peer reviewed authored/co-authored peer reviewed journals
2. In-situ charging system for implantable pacemakers
   Outcomes: Prototype developed, patent filed at Indian patent office
3. Biosensor for the detection of breast, lung, and oral cancer through breath
   Outcomes: Prototype developed, phase 1 clinical trials completed, patent granted

I have completed MTech dissertation work entitled “Preparation of graphene and its derivatives for bio-sensing application”. In this project, we developed graphene using the chemical vapor deposition technique and graphene oxide using the modified hummer’s method. Further, we have fabricated a graphene oxide-based glucose biosensor. After completing my M.Tech, I have worked in the cardiovascular group of India Medtronic Pvt Ltd for 13 months. During this period, I worked closely with prominent cardiologists of India and gave technical support in more than 100 surgeries for pacemakers and other cardiac devices implantations. I went through rigorous training during which I have learned thoroughly the concepts of implantable cardiac devices, especially pacemakers, CRTs, and ICDs. I joined IIT Roorkee as a Ph.D. scholar in Dec 2017. We have formed a start-up i.e., Healagnostic Innovations Pvt Ltd (HIPL), in 2019.
Currently I am a senior researcher working with Prof. Ramesh Chandra. I am working on the topic entitled “Fabrication of thin-film metal nitride-based biocompatible and flexible supercapacitor ”
