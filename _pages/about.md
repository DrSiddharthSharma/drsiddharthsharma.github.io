My research interests are energy generation and storage devices (nanogenerators and supercapacitors), biosensors, thin films, carbon nanotubes, graphene and polymer Nano-composites

### Innovations
1. Biocompatible and Flexible supercapacitors for implantable and wearable electronic devices
   Outcomes: 8 peer reviewed authored/co-authored peer reviewed journals
2. In-situ charging system for implantable pacemakers
   Outcomes: Prototype developed, patent filed at Indian patent office
3. Biosensor for the detection of breast, lung, and oral cancer through breath
   Outcomes: Prototype developed, phase 1 clinical trials completed, patent granted

### I  have formed a start-up Healagnostic Innovations Pvt Ltd (HIPL), in 2019.
Our innovation, 'Biosensor for detection of breast, lung, and oral cancer using exhaled breath,'
received the best innovation award in 2020 by the Confederation of Indian Industries
This technology was highlighted in different print and electronic media Formulized hand sanitizer with
herbal ingredients during the initial phase of COVID-19 & distributed over 150 Liters free of cost to the IIT
Roorkee community, Roorkee municipal corporation, & military hospital Roorkee.
This work was highlighted in more than 20 print and electronic media

Let's connect and embark on a journey of professional growth together.
