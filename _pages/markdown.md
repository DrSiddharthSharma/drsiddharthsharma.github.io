Projects
======
### Organization: IIT Roorkee
#### Project: Fabrication of Metal Nitride Thin Film-based flexible and Biocompatible Supercapacitor
#### Period: Apr’21 to Till Date
* Using the magnetron sputtering technique, we have successfully synthesized titanium nitride
(TiN) and Niobium nitride (NbN) thin film on flexible substrates
* The biocompatibility of the fabricated device was also investigated using an MTT assay
* Due to their flexibility and exceptional biocompatibility, these fabricated supercapacitors can
be used for energy storage in wearable and implantable electronic devices
Outcome: Authored/Co-authored eleven peer-reviewed papers in reputable scientific journals
and presented research findings at international conferences


### Organizations: IIT Roorkee in collaboration with SRHU Dehradun
#### Project: Breast, Lung and Oral Cancer Detection using Exhale Breath
#### Period: Aug’19 to Jun’20
Role: Co-investor
* We have designed a breath-based breast, lung, and oral cancer detector by exhaled breath and
patented it at the Indian patent office, application number 201911030871
* Clinical trials were done in one of India's renowned cancer research institutes, CRI, SRHU,
Dehradun
* This clinical study was conducted on 150 patients and 57 controls. (Got a chance to work
closely with oncologists and cancer patients)
* The observations were quite encouraging, demonstrating a sensitivity of 96.11% and a
specificity of 94.67%
Outcome: Patent granted by Indian patent office (patent number 432433, date of grant:
22/05/2023). This technology is acquired by TATA medical center Kolkata

### Organization: IIT Roorkee
#### Project: Nanogenerators for Healthcare Application
#### Period: Dec’17 to Mar’21
* We have fabricated a piezoelectric nanogenerator that can harvest the energy generated by
the movement of the human heart and convert it to electrical energy
* We have used piezoelectric polymer reinforced with second-phase nanomaterials
Outcome: Patent filed at Indian patent office (application number 202011038412). Heal agnostic
Innovations Pvt. Ltd. acquired this technology


### Organizations: NIT Kurukshetra in collaboration JNU and DU, New Delhi
#### Project: Preparation of Graphene and its Derivatives for Bio-sensing Application
#### Period: 2015 to 2016
* We have developed graphene using the chemical vapor deposition technique and graphene
oxide using the modified Hummer’s method
* Further, we have fabricated a graphene oxide-based glucose biosensor
Outcome: M. Tech. dissertation
